# Machine Learning:

This repository consists of notebooks that demonstrates some advanced machine learning concepts like:

- Document Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Model with EM
- Neural networks vs Multi-layer Perceptron 
- Self-taught learning

### Instructions:

Run each cell of the notebook to get the results.

Models in self-taught learning will take longer time to run/train. You may reduce number of epochs to reduce the training time at the cost of performance.
